## Installation Guide

To set up the project, install all dependencies from the root directory:

```bash
npm run install-all
```

This command installs dependencies for both the client and server.

## Running Guide

Before starting the development environment, **ensure that you have created a `.env` file** in the server directory and added the necessary environment variables.  

To start the development environment, run the following command from the root directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch both the client and server concurrently. The application will be accessible at:

-   **Client**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
-   **Server**: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

To start either the client or server individually:

```bash
# Start the client
npm run client

# Start the server
npm run server
```
